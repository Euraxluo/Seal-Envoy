# "Seal Envoy" - Cryptography Management Intelligent Assistant

## Project Introduction

"Seal Envoy" is an intelligent assistant based on MCP technology, designed to simplify complex cryptographic operations, enabling users to easily utilize the Seal key management system for data encryption, access control, and key sharing. Through a conversational interface, "Seal Envoy" can help users generate smart contracts, manage encryption keys, and execute secure data sharing without needing to understand the underlying cryptographic details.

## Project Background

Cryptographic technology is powerful but complex, making it difficult for ordinary users to apply correctly. The Seal key management system provides advanced Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) and Threshold Secret Sharing (TSS) capabilities, but requires specialized knowledge to use effectively. "Seal Envoy" bridges this gap through an AI assistant, making enterprise-grade cryptography accessible to all users.

## Core Features

### 1. Smart Contract Template Generation
- Automatically generate access control contracts based on user requirements
- Support various permission models (whitelist, multi-signature, role-based, etc.)
- Provide contract deployment and verification guidance

### 2. Key Management Wizard
- Guide users in generating and managing IBE keys
- Visualize key sharing schemes
- Secure backup and recovery recommendations

### 3. Simplified Encryption Operations
- Execute complex encryption tasks through natural language instructions
- Support encryption of files, messages, and data structures
- Provide threshold decryption collaboration processes

### 4. Cryptography Education
- Explain cryptographic concepts and best practices
- Visualize encryption processes
- Security risk assessment and recommendations

## Technical Implementation

"Seal Envoy" is built on the following technologies:

1. **MCP Service Framework**
   - Process natural language instructions into cryptographic operations
   - Smart contract code generation and analysis
   - Context-aware multi-turn dialogue

2. **Seal Cryptography Core**
   - Identity-Based Encryption (IBE)
   - Threshold Secret Sharing (TSS)
   - Finite Field Mathematics (GF256)
   - Secure symmetric encryption

3. **Blockchain Interaction Layer**
   - Smart contract deployment and interaction
   - Transaction building and submission
   - On-chain state verification

## Application Scenarios

### Enterprise Document Protection
Create encrypted document systems for enterprises, implementing granular permission controls like "3/7 board members must agree to view financial reports."

### Personal Data Security
Help individual users create "digital estate" plans, setting up conditions like "if inactive for 90 days, family can access my encrypted data."

### Team Collaboration Security
Provide secure management of code signing keys for development teams, ensuring critical operations require multiple approvals.

### Digital Asset Protection
Create multi-layered protection schemes for digital assets, preventing single points of failure from causing asset loss.

## Innovation and Advantages

1. **Lower Usage Barriers**: Transform complex cryptography into simple conversations
2. **Contract Code Generation**: Automatically create secure, auditable smart contracts
3. **Education Combined with Practice**: Learn while using, improving user security awareness
4. **Advanced Features Made Accessible**: Enable ordinary users to use enterprise-grade security technology

## Usage Flow Example

User: I need to create a secret sharing plan so that my financial files require approval from both my lawyer and spouse to access

"Seal Envoy": I understand your needs. I'll help you set up a 2/2 threshold sharing scheme. First, please upload the file you want to protect, or tell me where the file is located.

User: [Uploads file]

"Seal Envoy": Great, now I need you to provide the blockchain addresses or identity information for your lawyer and spouse, so I can generate the corresponding access control contract.

User: [Provides information]

"Seal Envoy": Thank you! I've generated a contract template and created encryption protection for your file. You can deploy the contract through the following steps...

"Seal Envoy" returns cryptography to its essence - becoming a tool for protecting data, rather than a technical barrier. Whether you're an enterprise decision-maker, development team, or ordinary user, you can easily apply advanced cryptographic technology to protect your digital assets and privacy.
